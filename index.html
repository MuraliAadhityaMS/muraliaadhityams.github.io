<h1>About Me:</h1>


From completing my Bachelor’s and Master’s in Biotechnology, and now pursuing a PhD in an interdisciplinary mix of Physics, Bioinformatics and Machine Learning, I am glad to be in this research journey integrating different fields of science and technology. 

I am cuurently a PhD candidate affiliated with the <a href="https://iitbmonash.org/welcome/studentDetails/july-2022/177">IITB-Monash Research Academy</a>, Mumbai, India. I work on the application of machine learning algorithms in bioinformatics to gain meaningful insights in biological datasets with <a href="https://www.phy.iitb.ac.in/en/faculty/mithun">Dr. Mithun Mitra, IIT Bombay</a> and <a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/sonika-tyagi">Dr. Sonika Tyagi, Monash University</a>. My current focus is on elucidating the molecular relationships between regulatory elements using omics datasets specific to human pregnancy.
