I am a PhD candidate, affiliated with the IITB-Monash Research Academy, Mumbai, India. I work on the application of machine learning algorithms in bioinformatics to gain meaningful insights in biological datasets. My current focus is on elucidating the molecular relationships between regulatory elements using omics datasets specific to human pregnancy.
